jquery-autosave is a JavaScript JQuery plugin that uses the Google Gears power
to save the form data using a unique hash code for current URL (or manually
informed) and allows future use or deletion.

This is useful to avoid users loss data when navigate on the browser before
they really was wanting (i.e: accidental mouse click or key press).

It is licensed under LGPL and you are free to distribute, modify, copy and use
since you respect the four points of the free software ideology.

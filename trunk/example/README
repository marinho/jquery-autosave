This is a Django project, because Google Gears doesn't work in local files, it
just needs an HTTP based path.

If you have Python and Django in your machine, just run the project with:

    python manage.py runserver

And loads the following URL in your web browser:

    http://localhost:8000/example1.html

To load a file in the same folder of example project.

If you haven't Django or want to use another way to load, just move those files
into a web browser documents root and it will work well also.
